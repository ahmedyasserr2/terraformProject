# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Project

This repository contains Terraform modules and configurations for deploying a multi-region AWS infrastructure, including VPCs, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables. Designed with modularity and reusability in mind, it facilitates a straightforward and efficient way to manage AWS resources.

## Project Structure

- `main.tf` - The main Terraform configuration file that integrates various modules for deployment.
- `variables.tf` - Defines variables used across the project.
- `modules/` - Contains reusable modules for each type of AWS resource:
  - `ec2/` - Module for creating EC2 instances.
  - `s3/` - Module for creating S3 buckets.
  - `vpc/` - Module for setting up VPCs, including subnets and internet gateways.
  - `dynamodb/` - Module for DynamoDB table creation.

## Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- An AWS account with the necessary permissions to create the resources defined in this project.
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ahmedyasserr2/terraformProject.git
    cd terraformProject
    ```

2. **Initialize Terraform** to download the necessary providers and modules:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. **Review the Terraform plan** to see the changes that will be applied:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

4. **Apply the Terraform configuration** to create the resources in AWS:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Customization

You can customize the deployment by modifying the variables in `variables.tf`. For more advanced customization, you can adjust the module configurations in `main.tf` or edit the individual modules.

## Cleanup

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.
